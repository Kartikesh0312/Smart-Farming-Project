# Smart Farming Assistant ðŸŒ¾ðŸšœ
# Overview
The Smart Farming Assistant is a Flask-based web application designed to empower farmers with AI-driven tools for sustainable agriculture. It provides actionable insights to optimize crop health, irrigation, and yield through machine learning and deep learning models, making farming smarter and more efficient.

# What It Achieves
Plant Disease Detection: Identifies plant diseases (e.g., Apple___Black_rot) using a ResNet18 model trained on the PlantVillage dataset (92% accuracy across 39 classes). It offers confidence scores (e.g., 95%) and practical recommendations (e.g., "Apply fungicide and prune affected branches") to help farmers act quickly and prevent crop loss.
Irrigation Prediction: Predicts irrigation needs with a Random Forest model (98% accuracy) based on inputs like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil moisture, ensuring crops get the right amount of water to thrive.
Crop Yield Estimation: Estimates crop yield (RÂ² score of 0.95) using factors like rainfall, temperature, fertilizer, and soil quality, helping farmers plan harvests and maximize productivity.
User-Friendly Design: Features an intuitive interface built with HTML, CSS, and Jinja2, complete with a thematic cornfield background and a footer for a professional look.

# Benefits for Farmers
This project helps farmers make data-driven decisions, reducing guesswork and improving outcomes. It detects diseases early to save crops, optimizes irrigation to conserve water, and predicts yields to plan betterâ€”ultimately boosting productivity and sustainability for small-scale farmers.
